<pre>MRS. ALVING. [Still in the doorway.] _Velbekomme_ [Note: A phrase
    equivalent to the German _Prosit die Mahlzeit_--May good digestion wait
    on appetite.], Mr. Manders. [Turns back towards the dining-room.] Aren't
    you coming too, Oswald?
    
    OSWALD. [From within.] No, thank you. I think I shall go out a little.
    
    MRS. ALVING. Yes, do. The weather seems a little brighter now. [She
    shuts the dining-room door, goes to the hall door, and calls:] Regina!
    
    REGINA. [Outside.] Yes, Mrs. Alving?
    
    MRS. ALVING. Go down to the laundry, and help with the garlands.
    
    REGINA. Yes, Mrs. Alving.
    
    [MRS. ALVING assures herself that REGINA goes; then shuts the door.]
    
    MANDERS. I suppose he cannot overhear us in there?
    
    MRS. ALVING. Not when the door is shut. Besides, he's just going out.
    
    MANDERS. I am still quite upset. I don't know how I could swallow a
    morsel of dinner.
    
    MRS. ALVING. [Controlling her nervousness, walks up and down.] Nor I.
    But what is to be done now?
    
    MANDERS. Yes; what is to be done? I am really quite at a loss. I am so
    utterly without experience in matters of this sort.
