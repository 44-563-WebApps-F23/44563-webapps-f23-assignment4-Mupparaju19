 MRS. ALVING. [Still in the doorway.] _Velbekomme_ [Note: A phrase
       equivalent to the German _Prosit die Mahlzeit_--May good digestion wait
       on appetite.], Mr. Manders. [Turns back towards the dining-room.] Aren't
       you coming too, Oswald?
    
    OSWALD. [From within.] No, thank you. I think I shall go out a little.
    
    MRS. ALVING. Yes, do. The weather seems a little brighter now. [She
    shuts the dining-room door, goes to the hall door, and calls:] Regina!
    
    REGINA. [Outside.] Yes, Mrs. Alving?
    
    MRS. ALVING. Go down to the laundry, and help with the garlands.
    
    REGINA. Yes, Mrs. Alving.
    
    [MRS. ALVING assures herself that REGINA goes; then shuts the door.]
